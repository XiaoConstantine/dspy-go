# Welcome to dspy-go

**dspy-go** brings the power of the [DSPy](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy) framework to the Go ecosystem. It provides a structured, programmatic, and optimizer-driven approach to building and tuning language model (LM) applications.

Instead of writing fragile, complex prompts, `dspy-go` allows you to define the building blocks of your application and then use powerful optimizers to find the best prompts and configurations for your specific task.

This documentation will guide you through the core concepts, modules, and features of the library.
